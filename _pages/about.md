In today's organizations, including institutions and companies, more people than ever before rely on insights from data. This increased access to data (data democratization) has increased risk of improper data sharing, data breaches, and inadequate data quality. These challenges have pressured organizations to enforce rules around who can access data, data quality, retention, etc. These rules are often spelled out in a written policy, and enforcing this policy on a storage system requires manual communication between the policy writers (e.g., security/legal experts) and storage system administrators (e.g., DB admins, data engineers, etc.). My PhD work aims to build systems that use NLP techniques, such as LLMs, to accurately audit storage system implementations against written policies to alleviate this type of overhead.

In the past, I have also worked with Prof. <a href='http://raulcastrofernandez.com/'>Raul Castro Fernandez</a> on related ideas of applying LLMs to data integration problems, metadata catalogs, and data markets.

I also consider myself very fortunate to have been exposed to a breadth of CS research prior to my PhD. I have worked with Prof. <a href='https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~shanlu/'>Shan Lu</a> on automatic bug detection in ORMs, Prof. <a href='http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~aelmore/'>Aaron Elmore</a> on compression for columnar storage formats, Prof. <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/abhishekparakh/'>Abhishek Parakh</a> on quantum analogues of classical encryption protocols, and Prof. <a href='https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-information-science-and-technology/about/faculty-staff/parvathi-chundi.php'>Parvathi Chundi</a> on novel topic modeling methods for privacy policies.
